<p>
You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant. 
One of you will be selected at random to be Participant 1; the other will be Participant 2. 
You will learn whether you are Participant 1 or 2 prior to making any decision.
</p>
<p>
To start, Participants 1 and 2 each receive {{Constants.amount_allocated}}. Participant 1 can send some or all of their 
{{Constants.amount_allocated}} to Participant 2. Before Participant 2 receives this, it will be tripled by the experimenter. 
The following table shows how this works.<br>

<center>
  <table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>If Participant 1 sends</th>
    <th>The experimenter will triple it</th> 
    <th>Participant 2 would receive</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">$0.00</td>
    <td align="center">3*$0.00</td> 
    <td align="center">$0.00</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center">$0.20</td>
    <td align="center">3*$0.20</td> 
    <td align="center">$0.60</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center">$0.40</td>
    <td align="center">3*$0.40</td> 
    <td align="center">$1.20</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center">$0.60</td>
    <td align="center">3*$0.60</td> 
    <td align="center">$1.80</td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center">$0.80</td>
    <td align="center">3*$0.80</td> 
    <td align="center">$2.40</td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center">$1.00</td>
    <td align="center">3*$1.00</td> 
    <td align="center">$3.00</td>
  </tr>
</table>
  </center>

<br>Once Participant 2 receives the tripled amount, he can decide whether to return some, all, or none of the tripled amount 
<u>to the same person</u> who gave it to them. The amount sent back to Participant 1 is not tripled again.
