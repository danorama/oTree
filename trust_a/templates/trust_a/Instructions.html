<p>
You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant. One of you will be selected at random to be participant A; the other will be participant B. You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior to making any decision.
</p>
<p>
To start, participant A and B each receive {{Constants.amount_allocated}}. Participant A can send some or all of their {{Constants.amount_allocated}} to participant B. Before B receives this, it will be tripled by the experimenter. Once B receives the tripled amount, B can decide to send some or all of their amount to A.
