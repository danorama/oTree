<p>
You will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant. In this study, one of you will be Participant 1
    and the other Participant 2. Prior to making a decision, you will learn your role, which will be randomly assigned.
</p>
<p>
Participant 1 has no decision to make.  Participant 2 will receive an amount of money that is determined by the amount of money given to Participant 1. 
The following table shows how this works.<br><br>
<center>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>If Participant 1 gets</th>
    <th>The experimenter will triple the amount less than $1.00</th> 
    <th>Participant 2 would receive</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">$1.00</td>
    <td align="center">3*$0.00</td> 
    <td align="center">$0.00</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center">$0.80</td>
    <td align="center">3*$0.20</td> 
    <td align="center">$0.60</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center">$0.60</td>
    <td align="center">3*$0.40</td> 
    <td align="center">$1.20</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center">$0.40</td>
    <td align="center">3*$0.60</td> 
    <td align="center">$1.80</td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center">$0.20</td>
    <td align="center">3*$0.80</td> 
    <td align="center">$2.40</td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center">$0.00</td>
    <td align="center">3*$1.00</td> 
    <td align="center">$3.00</td>
  </tr>
</table></center>
</p>
Participant 2 will have the task of deciding whether he wants to give any of his additional money to Participant 1.
