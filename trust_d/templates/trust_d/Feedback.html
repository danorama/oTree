 Suppose that both participants start with $1.00, then Participant 1 sends $0.20 to Participant 2. 
 The experimenter triples this amount, so Participant 2 receives $0.60.
 Having received the tripled amount, Participant 2 sends $0.50 to 
 Participant 1. In the end, how much would Participants 1 and 2 have?'
</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution:</strong> Participant 1 would have <strong>$1.30</strong> and 2 <strong>$1.10</strong>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Participant 1 first sent $0.20 to Participant 2. It was tripled thus Participant 2 received 3 x $0.20 = $0.60.
Then Participant 2 sent $0.50 to Participant 1. It was not tripled, so Participant 1 received exactly $0.50. Hence at last Participant 1 
would have $1.00 - $0.20 + $0.50 = $1.30 and Participant 2 would have $1.00 + $0.60 - $0.50 = $1.10.
