<p>
You were initially endowed with <strong>{{Constants.amount_allocated}}</strong>, chose to send <strong>{{group.sent_amount}}</strong>,
    received <strong>{{group.sent_back_amount}}</strong> thus you now have <strong>{{Constants.amount_allocated}}-{{group.sent_amount}}+{{group.sent_back_amount}}={{result}}</strong>.
{% else %}
Participant A sent you <strong>{{group.sent_amount}}</strong>. It was tripled so you received <strong>{{tripled_amount}}</strong>.
    You chose to return <strong>{{group.sent_back_amount}}</strong>.
</p>
<p>
You were initially endowed with <strong>{{Constants.amount_allocated}}</strong>, received <strong>{{tripled_amount}}</strong>, chose to return
    <strong>{{group.sent_back_amount}}</strong> thus you now have <strong>{{Constants.amount_allocated}}+{{tripled_amount}}-{{group.sent_back_amount}}={{result}}</strong>.
